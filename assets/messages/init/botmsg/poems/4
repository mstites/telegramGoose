Honk! honk! on stormy wings they cleave the upper air,
On gusty breeze, above the seas, their onward cohorts fare;
They come from frosty solitudes, where broods the Arctic night,
Where deserts grim, spread vast and dim, in the auroral light.
The Esquimaux, with bended bow, fast paddling his canoe,
Their flocks hath chas'd o'er icy waste of waters heavenly blue;
