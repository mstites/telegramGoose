The lake was thawing, the early spring sun reflected its glare,
two Canadian geese just landed, one plummeting through the air.

The other nestled beside her lifeless mate, silent in the reeds,
his still form was no longer receptive to his mate's nurturing needs.

She rested beside him, nudging softly, waiting for the same,
eyes blinking, not comprehending, waiting, but nothing came.

They had been joined together by nature's force to always be as one,
the pair had traveled many miles through rain, sleet and sun.

She picked a sprout of new green grass and tried to make him eat,
then gradually accepted fate, and laid it at his feet.

She glanced along the shoreline for a place to make a nest,
for instinct took over and nature did the rest.

The brilliant sun began to fade into the distant shore,
casting shadows where she'd lived, alone forever more.
