Noisy honking announces their nearness
A crew of morning geese arrive.
In an imperfect V formation
All experts in flying.

Sculling along
Their wings pushing against the air
With strokes silent and synchronized
Propelling them forward.

Each bird like an oarsman
Engaged together in a race to get to their destination
With one lone goose a short distance to the right
Like a coach in charge of the team
Encouraging them on.
