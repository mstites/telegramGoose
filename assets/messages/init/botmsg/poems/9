Every time the geese went honking
Overhead
I looked up at the sky.

Wherever they flew
They went honking.
Until they winged,
In a ragged V-shaped line,
To the south,
Because of the reservoir.

Or until they returned
In a ragged V-shaped line,
To the north,
Because of the pond.

The birds honked.
The water went shimmering
To the south, to the north,
And
Glimmered in the sun.

Later, the geese fed on golf course grass
And slept.
