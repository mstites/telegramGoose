# Telegram Goose
A bot to keep me busy during quarantine and give my girlfriend and I some laughs.

## Requirements:
* telegram-send
* group called "jenni.conf", create with the bash command "telegram-send --config jenni-.conf --configure"

## Ideas
* Could make more generic, have a translation table from command to thing to load in a text file or a spreadsheet

Make requirements.txt

Way to check if selected message contains () - a function


Trans support bot:
"Misgendered by professors"
* Do you need help writing a letter to a professor
